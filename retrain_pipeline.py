"""
ThreatLens - ML Pipeline Refactoring & Header Sanitization
==========================================================
Addresses data leakage in the baseline phishing classifier.
1. Strips all RFC 822 routing and envelope headers before vectorization.
2. Configures TfidfVectorizer with sublinear_tf=True and ngram_range=(1, 2).
3. Configures LogisticRegression with class_weight='balanced'.
4. Evaluates sanitized model and saves refactored pipeline to 'refactored_phishing_pipeline.pkl'.
