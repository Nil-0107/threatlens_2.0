## About The Project

**ThreatLens** is an end-to-end cyber-forensic platform built to address one of the most under-addressed problems in digital security today: Business Email Compromise (BEC), spear-phishing, brand impersonation, and wire fraud carried out through email.

Most existing tools stop at flagging a message as spam. ThreatLens goes three steps further — it explains why an email is fraudulent, traces where it actually came from, and produces tamper-proof, investigation-ready evidence, all from a single platform instead of three disconnected tools.

Inspired by real-world incidents such as the November 2025 email spoofing fraud involving Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Group Pharmaceuticals — where diverted funds were recovered only because police intervened within a narrow window of time — ThreatLens is built to catch such fraud before it happens, or trace it instantly if it doesn't.

---

## The Problem

Email fraud is easy to execute and difficult to trace once it succeeds. Spam filters catch obvious junk mail, but not targeted spoofing or Business Email Compromise, leaving businesses, banks, and government bodies exposed.

| Statistic | Source |
|---|---|
| 22% of India's 29.44 lakh cyber incidents (2025) are phishing-driven | CERT-In / SARO Threat Landscape Report |
| Only 1–3% of cybercrime complaints ever convert into an FIR | Vaarta Cybercrime Statistics Report |
| 24% spike in cybercrime cases, ₹22,495 crore lost nationally (2025) | InsightsIAS |
| ₹2.16 crore diverted via email spoofing — Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Nov 2025 | The Tribune |

Investigators are left without adequate tools to trace an email's true origin or preserve evidence that holds up in an investigation. ThreatLens is built to close that gap.

---

## Our Solution

ThreatLens runs every suspicious email through a single pipeline that performs five functions:

- **Detect** — Flags fraud with a clear, explainable risk score (0–100) and specific reasons
- **Trace** — Maps the email's real origin using its own header trail, not just its claimed sender
- **Correlate** — Automatically links related fraud attempts sharing the same sender domain or IP
- **Preserve** — Locks every finding into a tamper-proof, hash-chained forensic record
- **Result** — Hours of manual header and IP investigation reduced to seconds, with a report an investigator can act on immediately

---

## How It Works

ThreatLens runs as a continuous six-step cycle for every email:

```
1. Email Ingested        - Raw .EML upload, parsed via RFC 822/MIME
2. Header & Content Scan - SPF/DKIM/DMARC check, brand/spoofing matcher,
                            sanitized ML classifier, URL threat intel
3. Risk Scoring          - Risk Aggregator combines all signals into a 0-100 score
4. Origin Tracing        - Parses Received headers, geolocates IP hop sequence
5. Forensic Logging      - SHA-256 hash-chain Evidence Vault, sealed into SQLite ledger
6. Report & Dashboard    - Gemini AI incident briefing plus exportable PDF report
```

### Pipeline A — Detection

```
Email Upload -> Parser (RFC 822/MIME)
   -> SPF/DKIM/DMARC Check
   -> Spoofing & Brand Matcher (Levenshtein distance)
   -> Sanitized ML Classifier (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
   -> URL Blocklist & Threat Intel
   -> Risk Aggregator (0-100)
   -> Gemini AI Incident Briefing
```

### Pipeline B — Trace & Evidence

```
Received Header Chain -> IP Extraction (filters private IPs)
   -> GeoLocation Lookup (ip-api.com)
   -> Hop Sequence Map with Origin Highlighted
   -> SHA-256 Hash
   -> Evidence Vault (Hash Chain)
   -> SQLite Ledger & PDF Report Generator
```

### Key Technical Highlights

- **Brand Impersonation Detection** — Compares sender domains against protected brand lists using Levenshtein edit distance, and detects local-part impersonation (subtly altered lookalike addresses) and display-name mismatches.
- **Leak-Free ML Training** — The classifier vectorizes only the email body, stripping routing headers to prevent data leakage from local server names such as `postfix` or `localhost`.
- **Multilingual Urgency Detection** — Flags coercive urgency keywords across languages (for example, "expirando hoje," "immediate action," "unauthorized transfer").
- **Cryptographic Chain of Custody** — Every logged action is hashed as:

  ```
  entry_hash = SHA256(id || email_id || action || actor || timestamp || data_hash || prev_hash)
  ```

  If any historical entry is altered, the chain breaks and the tampering is detectable via the `/api/emails/{id}/verify-chain` endpoint or the `inspect_vault.py` CLI tool.
